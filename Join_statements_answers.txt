1. How do you find related data held in two separate data tables?
    A. Use a join statement combines information from two tables using the tables' primary keys.

2. Explain, in your own words, the difference between an INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, and RIGHT OUTER JOIN. 
Give a real-world example for each.
    A. An inner join will result in one row for each match on the primary/foreign key. Can be used when looking for an insured members name
        from one table and and all associated insurance policies from another table. 
    A left outer join will result in one row for each match on the primary/foreign keys as well as an additional row for each
        of the records from table 1 that don't have a match in table 2 (with null values from table 2). Can be used when looking for a list of
        all insured members from one table and all of their dependents, if they have any, from a second table.
    A right outer join will result in one row for each match on the primary/foreign keys as well as an
        additional row for each of records from table 2 that don't have a match in table 1 (with null values from table 1). Can be used when
        looking for a list of all employees that have insurance coverage from one table but still want the employee information from another
        table even if they don't have insurance coverage.

3. Define primary key and foreign key. Give a real-world example for each.
    A. A primary key is an identifier in a table that will occur only once in that table. A foreign key is the matching data in another 
    table. The foreign key is usually a small detail in a table of other identifying information. 
    In a table of employee information, an employee id would be the primary key. The employee id could also be an identifying column
    in a table of employee dependents. 

4. Define aliasing.
    A. Aliasing is simply assigning an alternate name or abbreviation to a table that is used when differentiating which columns to use. 

5. Change this query so that you are using aliasing:
    SELECT professor.name, compensation.salary,
    compensation.vacation_days FROM professor JOIN
    compensation ON professor.id =
    compensation.professor_id;
        A. SELECT p.name, c.salary, c.vacation_days FROM professor AS p JOIN compensation AS c ON p.id = c.professor_id;

6. Why would you use a NATURAL JOIN? Give a real-world example.
    You would use a natural join when two tables have several columns with the same names. You could use a natural join on employee tables
    when searching employee payroll info. Employee name, salary deposited, deposit account from one table and would match same date in a 
    payroll deposit table with all employee payroll payments.  

7. Using this Employee schema and data, write queries to find the following information:
List all employees and all shifts.
    select employees.id, name, date, start_time, end_time
    from employees
    left outer join scheduled_shifts
    on employees.id = scheduled_shifts.employee_id
    left outer join shifts 
    on shifts.id = scheduled_shifts.shift_id

8. Using this Adoption schema and data, please write queries to retrieve the following information and include the results:
Create a list of all volunteers. If the volunteer is fostering a dog, include each dog as well.
    select first_name, last_name, name
    from volunteers
    left outer join dogs 
    on foster_dog_id = dogs.id
            first_name	last_name	name
            Rubeus	Hagrid	Munchkin
            Marjorie	Dursley	Marmaduke
            Sirius	Black	(null)
            Remus	Lupin	(null)
            Albus	Dumbledore	(null)
The cat's name, adopter's name, and adopted date for each cat adopted within the past month to be displayed 
as part of the "Happy Tail" social media promotion which posts recent successful adoptions.
    select cats.name, adopters.first_name, adopters.last_name, cat_adoptions.date
    from cats
    join cat_adoptions
    on cat_adoptions.cat_id = cats.id
    join adopters
    on adopters.id = cat_adoptions.adopter_id
    where cat_adoptions.date > '2018-04-23';
        name	first_name	last_name	date
        Mushi	Arabella	Figg	2018-05-03
        Victoire	Argus	Filch	2018-05-08

Create a list of adopters who have not yet chosen a dog to adopt. - the way I wrote this one was not covered in this checkpoint, I was 
only able to do this because I've used SQL a lot in my current job. I was unable to get any sort of a join to work.
    select adopters.first_name, adopters.last_name
    from adopters 
    where id not in(select adopter_id from dog_adoptions);
        first_name	last_name
        Hermione	Granger
        Arabella	Figg
Lists of all cats and all dogs who have not been adopted. - again, was not able to generate correct results when using just what has
been discussed in the checkpoints, so I used prior SQL knowledge
    select cats.name
        from cats
        where id 
        not in (select cat_id from cat_adoptions)
        union
        select dogs.name
        from dogs
        where id
        not in(select dog_id from dog_adoptions);
                name
            Munchkin
            Nala
            Marley
            Marmaduke
            Seashell
            Boujee
            Lassie
The name of the person who adopted Rosco.
    select first_name, last_name
    from adopters
    join dog_adoptions
    on id=adopter_id;
        first_name	last_name
        Argus	Filch

9. Using this Library schema and data, write queries applying the following scenarios and include the results:
To determine if the library should buy more copies of a given book, please provide the names and position, 
in order, of all of the patrons with a hold (request for a book with all copies checked out) on "Advanced Potion-Making".
    select patrons.name, rank
    from patrons
    join holds
    on patrons.id = holds.patron_id
    join books
    on books.isbn = holds.isbn
    where books.title = 'Advanced Potion-Making';
        name	rank
    Cedric Diggory	2
    Terry Boot	1
List all of the library patrons. If they have one or more books checked out, list the books with the patrons.
    select name, checked_in_date
    from patrons
    left join transactions
    on transactions.patron_id = patrons.id
    This select statement will essentially get all employees and their check_in_date from the transactions table. I have been 
    unable to figure out how to display a column based on 'IF' another column exists. I would have to display a book name IF the
    checked_in_date is null (which. . . I couldn't even get the select statement to recognize checked_in_date = null in a simple
    SELECT statement). . .is this a little too advanced for where we are at?
