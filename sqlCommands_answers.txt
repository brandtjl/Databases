1. List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.
    A. INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE FROM 

2. Explain the structure for each type of command.
    A.  INSERT INTO filename (column1_name, column2_name, . . . ) values('value1', 'value2', ...);
        UPDATE filename set column_name = value where other_column_name = value;
        DELETE FROM filename where column_name = value;

3. What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example of each type.
    A. decimal or money for salaries, character for names, date or timestamp for date/time that an order was placed, numeric for a persons age 

4. Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. 
The table needs to have first and last names, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, 
and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).
    Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?
        First and last name. - varchar
        Whether they sent in their RSVP. - boolean
        Number of guests. - numeric
        Number of meals. - decimal
    Write a command that creates the table to track the wedding dinner.
        CREATE TABLE guests  (firstname, lastname, rsvp, num_of_guests, meals);
    Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.
        ALTER TABLE guests ADD COLUMN thank_you boolean SET DEFAULT false;
    You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, 
    so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.
        ALTER TABLE guests DROP COLUMN meals;
    The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.
        ALTER TABLE guests ADD COLUMN table_number SET DEFAULT 0;
    The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the table numbers from the database.
        ALTER TABLE guests DROP COLUMN table_number;

5. Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns 
ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.
    A. CREATE TABLE books (
        isbn varchar, 
        title varchar, 
        author varchar, 
        genre varchar, 
        publish_date numeric, 
        total_copies numeric,
        available_copies numeric  );

    Find three books and add their information to the table.
        INSERT INTO books (isbn, title, author, genre, publish_date, total_copies, available_copies) 
            values('978-1-4165-4997-0', 'The Broken Window', 'Jeffery Deaver', 'Mystery', 2008, 2, 1);
        INSERT INTO books (isbn, title, author, genre, publish_date, total_copies, available_copies) 
            values('978-0-312-36806-7', 'Quicksand', 'Iris Johansen', 'Mystery ', 2008, 1, 1);
        INSERT INTO books (isbn, title, author, genre, publish_date, total_copies, available_copies) 
            values('978-1-4165-7086-8', 'Just Take My Heart', 'Mary Higgins Clark', 'Mystery', 2009, 1, 0);

    Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies to 1 fewer.
        UPDATE books SET available_copies = available_copies -1 where title = 'Quicksand';

    Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.
        DELETE FROM books where title = 'Just Take My Heart';

6. Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, 
a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. 
    CREATE TABLE spacecrafts (
        id varchar, 
        name varchar, 
        launch_year numeric,
        country character,
        mission varchar,
        orbiting_body varchar,
        operating boolean,
        miles_from_earth varchar );

    In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:
    Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.
        INSERT INTO spacecrafts (id, name, launch_year, country, mission, orbiting_body, operating, miles_from_earth)
            VALUES (1, 'STEREO', 2006, 'USA', 'solar observation, 'sun', true, 'unknown');
        INSERT INTO spacecrafts (id, name, launch_year, country, mission, orbiting_body, operating, miles_from_earth)
            VALUES (2, 'Spitzer', 2003, 'USA', 'infrared space telescope, 'sun', true, 'unknown');
        INSERT INTO spacecrafts (id, name, launch_year, country, mission, orbiting_body, operating, miles_from_earth)
            VALUES (3, 'Kepler', 2009, 'USA', 'space observation, 'sun', true, 'unknown');

    Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.
        DELETE FROM spacecrafts where name = 'Kepler';

    Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.
        UPDATE spacecrafts set operating = false where name = 'STEREO';

7. Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. 
This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, 
whether or not you have read the email, and the id of the email chain it's in. 
    CREATE TABLE emails (
        id numeric,
        subject varchar,
        sender varchar,
        recipients varchar,
        body varchar,
        time_sent timestamp,
        email_read boolean,
        email_chain_id decimal );

Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

Add three new emails to the inbox.
    INSERT INTO inbox (id, subject, sender, recipients, body, time_sent, email_read, email_chain_id)
        VALUES (1, 'test', 'jenibrandt@legalshieldcorp.com', 'jdbrandt4@hotmail.com', 'Just letting you know its time to go to bed',
        '2018-05-23 08:15:00', true, 1.1);
    INSERT INTO inbox (id, subject, sender, recipients, body, time_sent, email_read, email_chain_id)
        VALUES (2, 'assignment', 'jenibrandt@test.com', 'jdbrandt4@gmail.com', 'Submit assignment',
        '2018-05-21 13:41:00', false, 2.1);
    INSERT INTO inbox (id, subject, sender, recipients, body, time_sent, email_read, email_chain_id)
        VALUES (3, 'schedule', 'jenibrandt@hotmail.com', 'jdbrandt4@gmail.com', 'Its time to set class schedule.',
        '2018-05-20 12:11:40', true, 3.1);

You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.
    DELETE FROM inbox where id=3;

You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating the crash, 
so you can come back and read it later.
    UPDATE inbox set email_read=false where id = 2;
