1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.
    A. SELECT id, title, author FROM books WHERE author = 'Stephen King';

2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.
    A. SELECT, FROM, WHERE - the order asks a question really. . . Select from where? 

3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:
Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

    Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.
        select name, gender, age from dogs where breed like '%labrador%';
    Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.
        select id from dogs where age < 1;
    Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.
        select name, age from dogs where gender = 'F' and weight > 35;
    Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.
        select * from dogs where breed not like '%shepherd%'; 
        or maybe 
        select * from dogs where breed not like '%shepherd mix' and breed not like 'shepherd%mix';
        . . . depends on what the user REALLY means by 'shepherd mix'!
    Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.
        select id, age, weight, breed from dogs where weight > 60 or breed = 'great dane';

4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

    SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;
        The name and adoption_date columns are returned for ALL records.
    SELECT name, age FROM cats;
        The name and age columns are returned for ALL records.

5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
    Display all the information about all of the available cats.
        select * from cats;
    Choose one cat of each age to show to potential adopters.
        select * from cats limit 3
            I get that this statement would only work if I know exactly what's in the database. .  . couldn't get 'distinct' to work
            correctly, so not sure how else that could be done.
    Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.
        select name from cats;

6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.
    A. >, <, =, >=, <=, <> 
        You could use > when looking for books with a publish date greater than 2010; you chould use < when looking for recipes
        with less than 5 ingredients; you could use = when looking for employees with title of 'Manager'; you could use >= when
        looking for employees with salary of 50,000 or more; you could use <= when looking for employees with a hire date prior to 
        January 1, 2018; you could use <> when looking for books that aren't by author 'Stephen King'

7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?
    SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;
        Seashell
        Nala
    SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
        Mushi 
        Seashell
        Victoire
        Nala
    SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
        3
        4
